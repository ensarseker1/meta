# Introduction to Nmap for Network Exploration

Every time you visit your local café to make use of their free Internet access, or hit up a hotspot in the park, or connect to your own home WiFi, you are not just throwing yourself into some uncertain ether known as the Internet; you are also connecting to your own local network -- your own LAN (which stands for Local Area Network). Like the Internet, which is really just a tremendous connecting of one local network to another, any given LAN is its own world full of treasures to discover. But connecting to a LAN, especially in a public space, can also present a number of security considerations.

You could think of connecting to a LAN at your favorite bar, in order to access the Internet, is kind of like jumping into a sailboat to sail across the ocean. You may be familiar with the surface of the ocean -- where your favorite memes, e-mail, blogs, and news sources all float across the surface on the waves. But what do you know about your own LAN and the devices on it? What do you know about the machine you're actually connecting to when you go to puppydog.party?

Using Nmap, a tool born in the early '90s, we'll use this workshop as a way to swan dive into the waves and discover what's swimming just underneath the surface of a network. You'll never look at your Internet café the same way again!
